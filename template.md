Project Title: Cyber-Guardian — A Digital Twin Framework for Autonomous Network Defense
1. Problem Statement
   
In modern cybersecurity, security analysts face two major bottlenecks:

Data Scarcity: High-quality, labeled "attack" data is often classified or unavailable due to privacy laws, making it impossible to train robust AI models.

Zero-Day Vulnerabilities: Traditional signature-based defense systems (and even basic Supervised ML) fail to detect "Zero-Day" attacks—new threats that have never been seen or labeled before.

The Solution: This project builds a Digital Twin of a corporate network. By generating 500,000+ rows of synthetic "normal" traffic, we create a consequence-free laboratory. We then use Hybrid Machine Learning—combining Supervised Classification for known threats with Unsupervised Deep Learning (Autoencoders) for unknown anomalies—to create an autonomous defense shield.


2. Why I Chose This Project
Privacy-Safe Innovation: It demonstrates how to bypass the need for sensitive production data by using CTGANs to create statistically identical synthetic datasets.

Technical Complexity: It covers the full data science lifecycle: from data generation and imbalanced class handling to deep learning and model interpretability.

Real-World Urgency: As cyber-attacks become more automated, the industry is moving toward "Digital Twin" simulations to stress-test defenses before a real breach occurs.


3. Where It Will Be Used (Industry Impact)
Fintech & Banking: To simulate high-frequency transaction networks and detect "low-and-slow" stealth attacks.

Industrial Control Systems (ICS): To create replicas of power grids or water treatment plants where real testing is too dangerous.

Security Operations Centers (SOC): As a training tool for analysts and an early-warning system for non-signature-based threats.
